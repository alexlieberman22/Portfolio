  <p>Its Friday, Friday, Gotta get down on Friday
-	Rebecca Black </p>
<p>Congratulations for surviving the week and the first 1/4th of the school year! IT is flying by.</p>

<p>It is the end of week 4 of this lovely semester and we are excited to see you at the beginning of week 5. We are happy to expand our Ramily and hope to see it continue to grow through this semester, year, and hopefully many years to come.</p> 

<p>Thank you and Welcome to our weekly emails where you will get updates about meetings, themes for projects, wise words from our one and only president and much more!</p>

<p>For this upcoming meeting, we will begin our first project. For this we ask that you pick a type of yarn art (knit or crochet) so that we can divide and concur. You are welcome to learn both but for the sake of ensuring you get the best experience we would recommend learning one at a time. For those of you have previous experience/ projects, you are welcome to bring those rather than completing a granny square. This club is a place for you to relax and work on things you would like to work on.</p> 

<p>We are also providing you a link to our presidents Ravelry, which is where you can find all the patterns that she has. You can go through those and if you see anything you would like to try you can let her know and she will print it out and bring it to you. 
Remember that no experience is necessary and be sure to invite all your friends.</p>
<p>-See you Tuesday September 19, 2017 </p>

      <p>Its Friyay everyone!</p>
    <p> It is officially the end of week 5 and it is time for some well-deserved relaxation!
      Thank you and Welcome to our weekly emails where you will get updates about meetings, themes for projects, wise words from our one and only president and much more! </p>
    <p> For this upcoming meeting, we will continue with our first projects. If you have completed your first project by next week’s meeting Congratulation! You are basically a pro now, if not, no worries! Knitting is more fun in a group setting anyways. For those of you that have completed a project and would like to move on to a new stitch or begin a pattern make sure to review the patterns that our president has picked out on her Ravelry as well as the patterns available on the KC Cub Ravelry.  The KC Club Ravelry is set up for both knitters and crocheters. Knitting patterns are located in the section marked library and crochet patterns are located in the section marked favorites. We try to keep them separate so that no one gets confused. *Note: in order to access Ravelry you will need to make an account. Accounts are free and easy to make/use.</p>
    <p>If you find a pattern that you love shoot us an email, or Facebook message or text me (Rae) @ 970-215-9563 and let us know so we can get it printed out and have it ready for you at the next meeting. </p>
    <p>Also, for the next meeting we would love to have a movie in the background so if everyone could email and let us know your movie preferences so we can get a list going to send out next Friday that would be wonderful. Have a wonderful weekend!</p>
    <p> -See you Tuesday October 3, 2017</p>

	<p>Hello my lovely yarn lovers!</p>

<p>It is officially that point in the semester where everything is winding down and coming to a close. This week’s meeting, tomorrow from 6-8pm in Eddy 102, will be the final meeting of the semester. For this meeting we will not be bringing extra supplies but we will still bring snacks. 
</p>
<p>Though this is the last meeting of the semester we will be restarting our meeting next semester, I will send out an email at some point during the first week of school with information about that. Keep in mind that next semester will be the beginning of election season, we will be providing you with the necessary information needed for anyone that wants to run for office. Also next semester I will be sending out a t-shirt design that we can vote on as a group and get those made and distributed. Lastly, begin thinking about little projects you would be interested in doing for our community project. I have attached a link to a project that I believe will be a great opinion for us to consider. After we’ve and a few meetings and I’ve had the chance to gather up everyone’s ideas I will email out a list and we can vote on which one to do (majority wins).</p>

<p>For now, I hope everyone has a wonderful final week of school and does well on all your finals. The end is near, you’ve got this!</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">"Finals are approaching. And your exams can be stressful, even rage inducing. But nothing can be as frustrating as having to rip back multiple rows because you missed a yarn over. Good luck on finals everyone! Finish strong!”</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">-Tasha Reed, President</p>
